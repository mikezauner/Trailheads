---------- Initial TODO and Feature Set ----------

TODO:
1) Figure out database structure
    a) Tentatively, columns for coords, trail name, description, difficulty marker, facilities.
2) Build code to access database
3) Build code to access GPS, and tie-ins to navigation
4) Figure out possibility of having topo maps of trail areas in offline storage
    a) Size requirements?  Other issues?
    b) Possibly use GMaps to display, or is there a better tie-in?
5) Build code to track position over time and build nav-trail
6) Allow for sorting by difficulty, distance, proximity to TH, etc.
7) Use Location class to calculate distance between current location and TH.
8) Add database marker to determine whether or not permit is required.
