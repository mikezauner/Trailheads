---------- Initial TODO and Feature Set ----------

TODO:
X) Figure out database structure
    a) Tentatively, columns for coords, trail name, description, difficulty marker, facilities.
X) Build code to access database
X) Build code to access GPS, and tie-ins to navigation
    a) TODO: Bug in onResume() bit.  Figure this out when less stoned on pain meds.
X) Figure out possibility of having topo maps of trail areas in offline storage
    a) Size requirements?  Other issues?
    b) Possibly use GMaps to display, or is there a better tie-in?
        i) using topo won't work.  gmaps doesn't work because of API issue. Using OSM is the best option.
5) Build code to track position over time and build nav-trail
6) Allow for sorting by difficulty, distance, proximity to TH, etc.
X) Use Location class to calculate distance between current location and TH.
X) Add database marker to determine whether or not permit is required.
9) Add trail submission form/gapps for mikezauner.com.
10) Figure out DB update scheme that doesn't require ridiculousness like a full app update.
11) Investigate adding other states and doing state-by-state maps/trail databases.
